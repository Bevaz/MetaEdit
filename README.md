## MetaEdit for Obsidian

## Features
- Add or update Yaml properties and Dataview fields easily
- Ignore properties to hide them from the menu
- Auto Properties that have customizable, pre-defined values selectable through a suggester
- Multi-Value Mode that allows you to detect and vectorize/create arrays from your values
- Progress Properties that automatically update properties/fields
  - Works with total task, completed task, and incomplete task counts. Mark a task as completed (from anywhere), and the file will be updated with the new count.
